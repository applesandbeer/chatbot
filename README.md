# chatbot
a basic Chat GPT clone made with python (Django), JS, and an open ai api call to provide answers
Made by following the freecodecamp.com tutorial on making a chatbot. I didn't add the login and 
registering functionality because I really just wanted to see how to set up a basic django site 
and set up an API call within.
